Here's a **complete theory-based answer** to **"RESTful API Development using Spring Framework"** with easy explanations and minimal code — perfect for a **10-mark exam**.

---

## ✅ **RESTful API Development using Spring Framework**

---

### 🔹 What is a RESTful API?

A **RESTful API** (Representational State Transfer) is a web service that allows clients to communicate with the server using standard HTTP methods like:

* `GET`: Retrieve data
* `POST`: Create data
* `PUT`: Update data
* `DELETE`: Delete data

---

### 🔹 Why Use Spring for REST API?

The **Spring Framework**, especially **Spring Boot**, is widely used to build REST APIs due to:

* Simplified configuration using annotations
* Built-in support for HTTP methods
* Integration with databases using Spring Data JPA
* Auto JSON response using Jackson
* Lightweight and scalable

---

### 🔹 Key Concepts in Spring REST API

| Concept             | Description                                                      |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `@RestController`   | Indicates the class handles REST API requests.                   |
| `@RequestMapping`   | Maps HTTP requests to handler methods.                           |
| `@GetMapping`, etc. | Shortcut annotations for `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`.         |
| `@PathVariable`     | Extracts value from the URI.                                     |
| `@RequestBody`      | Accepts request data (usually JSON) and converts to Java object. |
| `@Autowired`        | Automatically injects dependencies (e.g., service, repository).  |

---

### 🔹 Minimal Code Snippet (CRUD)

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/students")
public class StudentController {

    @GetMapping("/{id}")
    public String getStudent(@PathVariable int id) {
        return "Student ID: " + id;
    }

    @PostMapping("/")
    public String addStudent(@RequestBody String student) {
        return "Added: " + student;
    }

    @PutMapping("/{id}")
    public String updateStudent(@PathVariable int id, @RequestBody String student) {
        return "Updated student " + id;
    }

    @DeleteMapping("/{id}")
    public String deleteStudent(@PathVariable int id) {
        return "Deleted student " + id;
    }
}
```

> 🔹 This example uses `String` in request/response just to keep it minimal.

---

### 🔹 Workflow of a REST API in Spring

1. **Client** sends an HTTP request (like `GET /students/1`)
2. **Controller** handles the request and calls the service layer
3. **Service Layer** performs business logic
4. **Repository** accesses the database (using Spring Data JPA)
5. **Response** is returned as JSON by default

---

### 🔹 Advantages

* Easy to implement and test
* Lightweight and stateless
* Supports multiple formats (JSON/XML)
* Easily integrated with frontend frameworks (React, Angular)

---

### 🔹 Real-World Applications

* User management APIs
* E-commerce product/catalog APIs
* Mobile backend services
* Microservices communication

---

## ✅ **1) Spring Framework's Support for Building Web Applications & Key Features of Spring MVC**

### 🔹 What is Spring Framework?

Spring is a lightweight, open-source Java framework that helps developers build enterprise and web applications easily. It promotes **loose coupling** using **dependency injection (DI)** and provides modules for various layers (web, service, data, etc.).

---

### 🔹 Spring’s Web Support

Spring has a module called **Spring MVC (Model-View-Controller)**, which is perfect for creating **web applications**. It handles HTTP requests, maps them to controller methods, processes data, and sends responses (like HTML or JSON).

---

### 🔹 How Spring MVC Works (Request Flow)

1. **Client** sends a request →
2. **DispatcherServlet** receives it
3. Finds the matching controller using **HandlerMapping**
4. **Controller** processes and returns data
5. **ViewResolver** returns the final HTML page or JSON
6. **Response** is sent to the user

---

### 🔹 Key Annotations and Features in Spring MVC

| Annotation          | Purpose                                  |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `@Controller`       | Marks a class as a controller            |
| `@RequestMapping`   | Maps a URL to a method                   |
| `@GetMapping`, etc. | Shortcut for request methods (GET, POST) |
| `@RestController`   | Used for REST APIs (returns JSON/XML)    |
| `@Autowired`        | Dependency injection                     |

## ✅ 4) MVC Architecture in Java (with Example)

### 🔹 What is MVC?

**MVC** stands for **Model-View-Controller**, a design pattern used to build structured web and desktop applications.

| Layer      | Responsibility                                     |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Model      | Handles **data** and business logic                |
| View       | Handles **UI** (HTML, JSP, etc.)                   |
| Controller | Handles **input** and acts as a bridge between M-V |

---

### 🔹 Why Use MVC?

* Separates concerns (code is clean and maintainable)
* Easy to test, debug, and scale
* Reusable logic and UI

---

### 🔹 Java MVC (Without Frameworks)

Here’s a very simple example:

#### ▶️ Model: `Student.java`

```java
public class Student {
    private String name;
    private int roll;

    // Constructor
    public Student(String name, int roll) {
        this.name = name;
        this.roll = roll;
    }

    // Getters
    public String getName() { return name; }
    public int getRoll() { return roll; }
}
```

#### ▶️ View: `StudentView.java`

```java
public class StudentView {
    public void showDetails(String name, int roll) {
        System.out.println("Name: " + name);
        System.out.println("Roll No: " + roll);
    }
}
```

#### ▶️ Controller: `StudentController.java`

```java
public class StudentController {
    private Student model;
    private StudentView view;

    public StudentController(Student model, StudentView view) {
        this.model = model;
        this.view = view;
    }

    public void updateView() {
        view.showDetails(model.getName(), model.getRoll());
    }
}
```

#### ▶️ Main: `Main.java`

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Student s = new Student("Ravi", 101);
        StudentView v = new StudentView();
        StudentController c = new StudentController(s, v);
        c.updateView();
    }
}
```

---

### 🔹 Output:

```
Name: Ravi  
Roll No: 101
```

---

## ✅ 5) MVC Pattern with Examples; Spring's Implementation

### 🔹 Spring MVC Overview

Spring MVC is part of the **Spring Framework** and implements the MVC pattern to develop Java web apps. It separates web layers into:

| Component  | Role                                          |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Controller | Accepts requests and handles logic            |
| Model      | Contains data to be displayed                 |
| View       | Renders the data (HTML, JSP, Thymeleaf, etc.) |

---

### 🔹 Spring MVC Flow

```
User Request → DispatcherServlet → Controller → Service (optional) → Model → View
```

---

### 🔹 Easy Spring MVC Example

#### 1. `HelloController.java`

```java
import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;
import org.springframework.ui.Model;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;

@Controller
public class HelloController {
    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public String showHello(Model model) {
        model.addAttribute("msg", "Welcome to Spring MVC!");
        return "hello"; // Points to hello.jsp or hello.html
    }
}
```

#### 2. `hello.jsp` (View)

```jsp
<%@ page language="java" contentType="text/html" %>
<html>
<body>
  <h1>${msg}</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

---

### 🔹 Important Spring MVC Annotations

| Annotation        | Purpose                              |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `@Controller`     | Declares a controller class          |
| `@RequestMapping` | Maps URL to method (GET, POST, etc.) |
| `@GetMapping`     | Handles GET requests                 |
| `Model`           | Passes data to the view              |

---

### 🔹 Benefits of Spring MVC

* Built-in REST and Web support
* Annotations make code clean
* Easy form handling and validations
* Works well with Maven, Spring Boot, etc.

## ✅ 6) Importance of RESTful APIs & Using Spring to Create RESTful Services

### 🔹 What is a RESTful API?

**REST** (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing web services that use HTTP for communication between client and server.

---

### 🔹 Importance of RESTful APIs

| Importance                         | Description                                         |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔗 Interoperability                | Works with any client (mobile, web, IoT) using HTTP |
| ⚙️ Scalability                     | Stateless nature helps scale easily                 |
| ♻️ Reusability                     | APIs can be reused across apps/projects             |
| 📦 Separation of Client & Server   | Frontend and backend can evolve independently       |
| 📡 Language-agnostic Communication | REST works with any programming language over HTTP  |

---

### 🔹 REST Constraints

* **Stateless**: No client context stored on server
* **Client-Server**: Separation of concerns
* **Cacheable**: Responses can be cached
* **Uniform Interface**: Consistent resource naming (`/users`, `/orders`)
* **Layered System**: Scalability via proxies/load balancers

---

### 🔹 Using Spring to Create RESTful Services

Spring simplifies RESTful APIs via `@RestController` and HTTP method annotations:

#### ▶️ Example

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api")
public class UserController {

    @GetMapping("/user")
    public String getUser() {
        return "John Doe";
    }

    @PostMapping("/user")
    public String createUser(@RequestBody String user) {
        return "User created: " + user;
    }
}
```

> Just run this on a Spring Boot app and test with Postman!

---

### 🔹 Key Spring Annotations

| Annotation        | Use                            |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `@RestController` | Returns data instead of a view |
| `@RequestMapping` | Maps URL paths                 |
| `@GetMapping`     | Handles HTTP GET requests      |
| `@PostMapping`    | Handles HTTP POST requests     |
| `@RequestBody`    | Accepts JSON body input        |

---

## ✅ 7) Servlets, Java Servlet Architecture vs. MVC Architecture; Advantages of MVC

### 🔹 What is a Servlet?

A **Servlet** is a Java program that runs on a web server, processes client requests (usually HTTP), and sends back a response (usually HTML).

---

### 🔹 Java Servlet Architecture

| Component  | Role                                     |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Client     | Browser or mobile app sends HTTP request |
| Web Server | Forwards request to Servlet container    |
| Servlet    | Executes logic and prepares response     |
| Response   | Sent back to the client                  |

---

#### ▶️ Example Servlet Code

```java
public class HelloServlet extends HttpServlet {
    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse res) 
            throws ServletException, IOException {
        res.getWriter().println("Hello from Servlet!");
    }
}
```

---

### 🔹 MVC Architecture

**MVC (Model-View-Controller)** separates the application logic into 3 parts:

* **Model** – Handles data (e.g., Java classes, DB access)
* **View** – UI (e.g., JSP, HTML)
* **Controller** – Logic to handle user input and decide response

---

### 🔹 Servlet Architecture vs MVC

| Feature         | Servlet Architecture        | MVC Architecture                           |
| --------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Code Structure  | Mixed logic (HTML + Java)   | Separation of concerns                     |
| Maintainability | Hard to maintain            | Easy to manage and scale                   |
| Reusability     | Low                         | High                                       |
| Testing         | Difficult                   | Easy to unit test                          |
| View            | Built in Java (PrintWriter) | View rendered separately (JSP, HTML, etc.) |

---

### 🔹 Advantages of MVC

* Clear separation of concerns
* Easy maintenance and scalability
* Reusable components
* Better testability
* Organized project structure

### 🔹 What is Spring JDBC?

**Spring JDBC** is a module in the Spring Framework that simplifies database access using **JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)**. It provides a higher-level abstraction over traditional JDBC code, reducing boilerplate and handling repetitive tasks like:

* Opening/closing connections
* Executing queries
* Mapping results to objects

---

### 🔹 Why Use Spring JDBC?

| Benefit                    | Description                                                        |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ✅ Less Boilerplate Code    | Spring handles resource management (connections, statements, etc.) |
| 🎯 Simple & Consistent API | Uses `JdbcTemplate` for DB operations                              |
| 🔄 Transaction Management  | Integrates seamlessly with Spring's transaction APIs               |
| 🔒 Security Ready          | Can be used with Spring Security for DB-based auth                 |
| 🛠️ Easy to Configure      | Declarative config via annotations or XML                          |

---

### 🔹 Spring JDBC Components

| Component                    | Purpose                                                     |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `JdbcTemplate`               | Core class to interact with DB (execute SQL, query, update) |
| `DataSource`                 | Represents the DB connection pool                           |
| `RowMapper<T>`               | Maps each row of a ResultSet to a Java object               |
| `NamedParameterJdbcTemplate` | Allows using named parameters in SQL queries                |

---

### 🔹 Small Example – Using Spring JDBC

```java
@Repository
public class UserDAO {

    @Autowired
    private JdbcTemplate jdbcTemplate;

    public int createUser(String name, String email) {
        String sql = "INSERT INTO users(name, email) VALUES (?, ?)";
        return jdbcTemplate.update(sql, name, email);
    }

    public List<User> getAllUsers() {
        String sql = "SELECT * FROM users";
        return jdbcTemplate.query(sql, new BeanPropertyRowMapper<>(User.class));
    }
}
```

---

### 🔹 Configuration (application.properties)

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=admin
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
```

---

### 🔹 When to Use Spring JDBC?

* When you need full control over SQL
* For lightweight CRUD applications
* For performance-critical DB access
* When ORM (like Hibernate) is too heavy

Let me know if you'd like to explore **Spring Data JPA**, which builds on top of Spring JDBC and adds ORM-like features using Hibernate.

---

Certainly! Here's the **Normalization in Database Design** explained **with simple table examples**, suitable for exams.

---

## ✅ Normalization in Database Design

---

### 🔹 **What is Normalization?**

Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to:

* Avoid **redundancy**
* Prevent **anomalies**
* Ensure **data integrity**

---

### 🔹 **Why Normalize?**

| Problem Without Normalization   | Example                                     |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Repetition of data (redundancy) | Same student details repeated for subjects  |
| Insertion anomaly               | Can’t add a new course without student data |
| Update anomaly                  | Change in one place requires many updates   |
| Deletion anomaly                | Deleting one row may lose important info    |

---

## 🔸 Normal Forms (With Simple Examples)

---

### ✅ 1NF – **First Normal Form**

**Rule**: Each cell should hold **one value only** (atomic).

❌ *Before 1NF:*

| Student | Subjects      |
| ------- | ------------- |
| Ram     | Math, Science |

✅ *After 1NF:*

| Student | Subject |
| ------- | ------- |
| Ram     | Math    |
| Ram     | Science |

---

### ✅ 2NF – **Second Normal Form**

**Rule**: Must be in 1NF + **no partial dependency**

💡 Partial Dependency = When a column depends only on part of a **composite key**

❌ *Before 2NF:*

| StudentID | CourseID | Instructor |
| --------- | -------- | ---------- |
| 1         | 101      | Mr. A      |
| 1         | 102      | Mr. B      |

Here, `Instructor` depends only on `CourseID`, not both keys.

✅ *After 2NF (Split Table):*

**StudentCourse Table:**

| StudentID | CourseID |
| --------- | -------- |
| 1         | 101      |
| 1         | 102      |

**Course Table:**

| CourseID | Instructor |
| -------- | ---------- |
| 101      | Mr. A      |
| 102      | Mr. B      |

---

### ✅ 3NF – **Third Normal Form**

**Rule**: Must be in 2NF + **no transitive dependency**

💡 Transitive Dependency = A → B → C
(Non-key depends on another non-key)

❌ *Before 3NF:*

| StudentID | DeptID | DeptName |
| --------- | ------ | -------- |
| 1         | D01    | CSE      |
| 2         | D02    | ECE      |

Here, `DeptName` depends on `DeptID`, not directly on `StudentID`.

✅ *After 3NF (Split Table):*

**Student Table:**

| StudentID | DeptID |
| --------- | ------ |
| 1         | D01    |
| 2         | D02    |

**Department Table:**

| DeptID | DeptName |
| ------ | -------- |
| D01    | CSE      |
| D02    | ECE      |

---

### ✅ BCNF – **Boyce-Codd Normal Form**

**Rule**: For every functional dependency, the **determinant must be a candidate key**

Used when 3NF doesn't remove all anomalies.

---

## 🔸 Summary Table

| Normal Form | Rule                                 | Example Fix                    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| 1NF         | No multivalued cells                 | Separate rows for each subject |
| 2NF         | No partial dependency on primary key | Split course and instructor    |
| 3NF         | No transitive dependency             | Move dept name to new table    |
| BCNF        | Determinant must be a candidate key  | Advanced fix over 3NF          |

---

### 🧠 Final Notes

* Normalize till **3NF** for most real-world applications.
* After 3NF, over-normalization can hurt **performance**.
* **Balance is key**: normalize enough to remove redundancy, but not too much to slow down queries.

---

Let me know if you want **denormalization** or a **diagram-based example** too!

---

Absolutely! Here's a **detailed and simple explanation** of each topic for your exam:

---

## ✅ 4. **Transactions and ACID Properties in SQL Databases**

### 🔹 What is a Transaction?

A **transaction** is a single unit of work that consists of one or more SQL statements. It's used to **ensure data consistency**.

💡 Example:
In banking, transferring ₹1000 from A to B involves:

* Deducting from A
* Adding to B
  Both must succeed or both must fail — that's a transaction.

---

### 🔹 ACID Properties

**ACID** ensures reliability in database transactions:

| Property        | Description                                                     |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A**tomicity   | All steps succeed or nothing happens.                           |
| **C**onsistency | Maintains valid state of DB before & after transaction.         |
| **I**solation   | Concurrent transactions don't interfere with each other.        |
| **D**urability  | Once committed, changes are permanent even after power failure. |

---

### 🔹 SQL Example:

```sql
BEGIN;

UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 1000 WHERE id = 'A';
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 1000 WHERE id = 'B';

COMMIT;
```

If any statement fails, we can `ROLLBACK;` to undo.

---

## ✅ 5. **SQL vs NoSQL Databases: Scalability & Flexibility**

| Feature             | SQL (Relational DBs)             | NoSQL (Non-Relational DBs)           |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Examples**        | MySQL, PostgreSQL                | MongoDB, Cassandra, Firebase         |
| **Structure**       | Tables (rows & columns)          | JSON / documents / key-value / graph |
| **Schema**          | Fixed schema                     | Flexible schema                      |
| **Scalability**     | **Vertical** (add more power)    | **Horizontal** (add more machines)   |
| **ACID Compliance** | Strong ACID support              | Often eventual consistency           |
| **Best For**        | Structured data, complex queries | Big data, fast-growing apps          |

---

### 🔹 SQL is Better When:

* Data is **structured** and relational
* Strong **data integrity** is needed
* Complex **joins** and queries are common

### 🔹 NoSQL is Better When:

* Data is **semi/unstructured**
* App needs **fast read/writes**
* Data model changes frequently
* Needs to **scale horizontally**

---

## ✅ 6. **How CI/CD Streamlines Development & Deployment**

### 🔹 What is CI/CD?

**CI/CD** = Continuous Integration + Continuous Delivery/Deployment
It automates code building, testing, and deployment.

---
