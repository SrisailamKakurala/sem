# **1. Explain the evolution of RPA from traditional automation to intelligent automation.**

*(10 Marks – Comprehensive, Easy to Understand)*

## **Introduction**

Automation has been used for decades to reduce manual work. Early automation was rule-based and rigid. Over time, it evolved into modern Robotic Process Automation (RPA), which itself is now transforming into Intelligent Automation, where software robots combine rules with AI skills.

---

## **1. Traditional Automation (Before RPA)**

Traditional automation was:

* **Hard-coded** programs written by developers.
* Used mainly in **back-end systems** like databases, servers, and mainframes.
* Worked only for **predefined, structured data**.
* Expensive and time-consuming to build.

### **Limitations of Traditional Automation**

* Could not handle changes in screens or processes.
* Required deep programming knowledge.
* Not suitable for business users.
* Not flexible for frequent process changes.

---

## **2. Emergence of RPA**

RPA appeared to overcome these limitations.

### **Key Features of RPA**

* **Mimics human actions** like clicking, typing, reading screens.
* Works through the **user interface**, not the back-end.
* Uses **workflow design tools** instead of coding.
* Can handle repetitive and rule-based tasks without errors.

### **Benefits Over Traditional Automation**

* Easy to build and deploy.
* Cost-effective.
* Works with any application—legacy or modern.
* No coding needed for most tasks.

---

## **3. Rise of Intelligent Automation (IA)**

As business needs increased, RPA expanded into Intelligent Automation.

### **What is Intelligent Automation?**

It is RPA combined with:

* **AI (Artificial Intelligence)**
* **Machine Learning**
* **OCR/Text recognition**
* **Chatbots**
* **Natural Language Processing**

This allows bots to understand, learn, and make decisions.

---

## **4. Stages of Evolution**

### **Stage 1: Basic Automation**

* Scripts, macros
* Only simple tasks

### **Stage 2: Traditional Automation (IT automation)**

* Hard-coded programs
* System-level automation
* Rigid architecture

### **Stage 3: RPA (Rule-based UI Automation)**

* Software bots replicate human actions
* Handles structured inputs
* No coding needed

### **Stage 4: Intelligent Automation (Cognitive RPA)**

* Bots handle semi-structured data
* Make decisions using AI
* Learn from patterns

---

## **5. Examples of Evolution**

* **Traditional:** Excel macros to process data
* **RPA:** UiPath robot reading invoices and entering data
* **Intelligent Automation:** Bot reading scanned invoices using OCR and deciding if payment is valid using ML

---

## **Conclusion**

RPA evolved from basic automation to a more intelligent, cognitive framework that can automate complex tasks. This evolution has made business operations faster, more accurate, and more scalable.

## **1. Difference in Technology**

* Traditional automation modifies **internal system code**, APIs, or backend processes.
* RPA interacts like a **human**, operating the mouse, keyboard, and UI elements.

---

## **2. Difference in Scope**

### **Traditional Automation Scope**

* Financial systems
* Databases
* Batch processing
* ERP internal modules
* Works only where deep system access is allowed

### **RPA Scope**

# **4. Analyze the limitations and challenges of implementing RPA in real-time scenarios.**

*(10 Marks – Analytical Answer)*

## **Introduction**

While RPA is powerful, implementing it in real-world systems involves several challenges related to technology, process complexity, and business readiness.

---

## **1. High Process Variability**

If a process changes frequently, bots break easily because they follow fixed rules.
Example: UI label changes, website layout updates.

---

## **2. Unstructured or Inconsistent Data**

Bots struggle with handwritten text, unclear images, or unpredictable inputs without AI support.

---

## **3. Integration Issues**

Legacy systems may behave unpredictably or crash often, interrupting bots.

---

## **4. High Initial Setup Costs**

Licensing, training, and infrastructure may be expensive for small companies.

---

## **5. Poor Process Selection**

Automating unsuitable processes (e.g., decision-heavy tasks) leads to bot failures.

---

## **6. Employee Resistance**

People may fear job loss, reducing cooperation during implementation.

---

## **7. Scalability Problems**

Increasing bot numbers requires careful management of schedules, queues, and exceptions.

---

## **8. Security and Access Issues**

Bots need login credentials; improper handling may cause security risks.

---

## **9. Maintenance Overhead**

Bots must be updated frequently as applications change.

---

## **10. Lack of Governance**

Without proper monitoring and version control, bots may behave inconsistently.

---

## **Conclusion**

RPA offers huge benefits but requires proper planning, monitoring, and stable processes. Understanding these limitations helps ensure successful implementation.

---
