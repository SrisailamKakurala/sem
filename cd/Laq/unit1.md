1. Relief Displacement – Height of Building (Theory Only)

✅ What is Relief Displacement?

Relief displacement is the shift of objects in aerial photographs due to height difference.

👉 In simple words: Tall objects (like buildings, towers) appear to be leaning outward from the center of the photo.

This happens because:

Camera is above the ground.

Higher objects are closer to the camera.

So they appear displaced.



---

✅ How Height is Found (Concept Only)

To find height:

We compare the position of the top of the building and the base of the building in the photo.

The difference in position gives displacement.

More displacement → taller object.



---

✅ Important Points

Occurs only in aerial photographs.

Displacement increases as object height increases.

Used in photogrammetry to measure building height.



---

2. What is Parallax? How to Find Height using Parallax Bar?

✅ What is Parallax?

Parallax is the apparent shift of an object when viewed from two different positions.

👉 Simple example: Close one eye, then switch eyes — object appears to move slightly.

In aerial photography:

Two overlapping photos are taken.

Object appears in slightly different positions.

That shift is called parallax.



---

✅ Parallax Bar

A parallax bar is a tool used to measure this shift between two photos.


---

✅ How Height is Found (Concept)

Measure parallax at ground level.

Measure parallax at top of building.

Difference gives height information.


More parallax difference → taller object.


---

3. Components of Ideal Remote Sensing System

✅ What is Remote Sensing?

Remote sensing means collecting information about Earth without touching it (using satellites or aircraft).


---

✅ Components

1️⃣ Energy Source

Usually the Sun.


---

2️⃣ Atmosphere

Energy travels through atmosphere.


---

3️⃣ Target (Earth Surface)

Energy hits Earth objects (soil, water, vegetation).


---

4️⃣ Sensor

Device that collects reflected energy.


---

5️⃣ Platform

Carries the sensor (satellite or aircraft).


---

6️⃣ Data Processing

Raw data is processed into images.


---

7️⃣ Interpretation

Scientists analyze the images.


---

✅ Flow:

Sun → Atmosphere → Earth → Sensor → Processing → Interpretation


---

4. Energy Interaction with Earth Surface

When sunlight hits Earth, three things happen:


---

1️⃣ Reflection

Energy bounces back.
Example: Snow reflects more light.


---

2️⃣ Absorption

Energy is absorbed and converted into heat.
Example: Black soil absorbs more heat.


---

3️⃣ Transmission

Energy passes through material.
Example: Clear water allows some light to pass.


---

✅ Why Important?

Different materials reflect energy differently.

Example:

Vegetation reflects more in near-infrared.

Water absorbs more energy.


This difference helps identify objects in satellite images.


---

5. Spatial and Non-Spatial Data
