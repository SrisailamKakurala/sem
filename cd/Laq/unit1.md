# **7. Explain Peer-to-Peer Network, Public Key Cryptography, and Distributed Consensus.**

*(8 Marks – Simple Explanation)*

## 1️⃣ Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Network

### ✅ What is it?

A **Peer-to-Peer network** is a network where computers connect **directly to each other**, without a central server.

👉 In blockchain, every computer (called a **node**) shares data with other nodes.

### ✅ How it works:

* When a transaction happens, it is shared with all nodes.
* Every node stores a copy of the blockchain.
* No central authority controls it.

### ✅ Advantages:

* No single point of failure
* More secure
* Fully decentralized

---

## 2️⃣ Public Key Cryptography

### ✅ What is it?

Public Key Cryptography is a security method using **two keys**:

* **Public Key** → shared with everyone
* **Private Key** → kept secret

👉 Think of it like:

* Public key = Bank account number
* Private key = ATM PIN

### ✅ How it works in blockchain:

* If you send money, you sign the transaction using your **private key**.
* Others verify it using your **public key**.
* This ensures security and ownership.

### ✅ Why important?

* Prevents fraud
* Protects identity
* Secures transactions

---

## 3️⃣ Distributed Consensus

### ✅ What is it?

Distributed Consensus means **all nodes agree on the same data** before adding it to the blockchain.

👉 Since there is no central authority, everyone must agree.

### ✅ Why needed?

To prevent:

* Double spending
* Fake transactions

### ✅ Example:

If 100 computers are in the network, majority must agree that the transaction is valid.

### ✅ Popular consensus methods:

* Proof of Work
* Proof of Stake
* Proof of Elapsed Time

---

# **8(a). Explain Ledger and Wallet in detail.**

*(5–6 Marks)*

## 📘 Ledger

### ✅ What is Ledger?

A **ledger** is a record book of all transactions.

👉 In blockchain, ledger is:

* Digital
* Distributed (stored on many computers)
* Immutable (cannot be changed once added)

### ✅ Types:

1. Public Ledger → Everyone can see it
2. Private Ledger → Only authorized users can see it

### ✅ Features:

* Transparent
* Secure
* Permanent record

---

## 👛 Wallet

### ✅ What is Wallet?

A **wallet** stores your **private key and public key**, not actual coins.

👉 It allows you to:

* Send cryptocurrency
* Receive cryptocurrency
* Check balance

### ✅ Types:

1. Hot Wallet → Connected to internet
2. Cold Wallet → Offline storage

### ✅ Important:

If you lose your private key → You lose access to your funds.

---

# **8(b). Discuss Proof-of-Elapsed Time (PoET) algorithm in detail.**

*(5–6 Marks)*

## ✅ What is PoET?

Proof-of-Elapsed Time is a **consensus algorithm** used in permissioned blockchain.

It randomly selects who will create the next block.

---

## ✅ How it works:

1. Each node requests a random waiting time.
2. The node with the shortest waiting time wins.
3. That node creates the next block.
4. Others verify it.

👉 Like a lottery system.

---

## ✅ Advantages:

* Energy efficient (unlike Proof of Work)
* Fair random selection
* Fast processing

---

## ❌ Disadvantages:

* Works mainly in private/permissioned networks
* Requires trusted hardware

---

---

## ❌ Limitations:

* Slow transactions
* High energy consumption
* Scalability issues

---

# **10. Explain how smart contracts change the state through transactions.**

*(8 Marks – Easy and important)*

## ✅ What is State?

State means the **current condition of the blockchain**.

Example:

* Account balances
* Contract data
* Ownership records

---

## ✅ What is Transaction?

A transaction is an action that changes data.

Example:

* Sending money
* Updating contract information

---

## ✅ How Smart Contracts Change State:

1. User sends a transaction.
2. Transaction reaches smart contract.
3. Contract checks conditions.
4. If conditions are true → action is executed.
5. Blockchain state gets updated.

---

### Example:

Smart Contract rule:
“If payment = 1000 → transfer ownership”

Before transaction:
Owner = Person A

After transaction:
Owner = Person B

👉 State changed.

---

## ✅ Important Points:

* State change only happens after network approval.
* Every state change is recorded permanently.
* Cannot modify old transactions.
