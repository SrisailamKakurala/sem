| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Type and Scale of the Project**      | Large-scale or high-risk projects may need complex methods like matrices or modeling. Small-scale may use checklists.                     |
| **2. Nature of Environmental Impact**     | If multiple environmental components are affected (air, water, biodiversity), a comprehensive method is needed.                           |
| **3. Availability of Data**               | Some methods need detailed data (e.g., network analysis), while others like Ad-hoc work with minimal data.                                |
| **4. Time and Cost**                      | Some methods are time-consuming and expensive. Budget constraints may limit options.                                                      |
| **5. Expertise of the EIA Team**          | Some methods require skilled experts (e.g., simulation models). For basic expertise, simpler methods like overlays/checklists are better. |
| **6. Public Participation Involvement**   | For high stakeholder involvement, participatory approaches and transparent methods are required.                                          |
| **7. Legal and Institutional Guidelines** | Some countries or institutions prescribe specific methods based on the project category.                                                  |
| **8. Level of Detail Required**           | If the study is preliminary, a Rapid EIA may be used. For full analysis, Comprehensive EIA is better.                                     |

Here is the detailed answer for **Set-4, Question 5**:

---

### **Q5. Explain in detail about prediction and assessment of impact of Noise on flora and fauna during development of a project**

---

## ‚úÖ **Introduction to Noise Pollution in Development Projects:**

Noise pollution is **unwanted or harmful sound** that can disturb natural habitats. During construction or operation phases of a project (like roads, airports, industries), noise levels can **drastically increase**, affecting both **flora (plants)** and **fauna (animals, birds, insects)**.

---

## üîä **Sources of Noise in Projects:**

| Phase              | Noise Sources                                           |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Construction Phase | Bulldozers, trucks, concrete mixers, drilling equipment |
| Operation Phase    | Traffic, industrial machines, generators, turbines      |

---

## üåø **Impact of Noise on Flora (Plants):**

Plants **do not have ears**, but they are still affected **indirectly** by noise due to changes in the environment.

| Effect               | Explanation                                                       |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Growth reduction     | Vibration affects soil and root stability                         |
| Pollination problems | Birds and insects avoid noisy zones, leading to fewer pollinators |
| Habitat degradation  | Continuous noise can degrade ecosystem quality                    |

---

## üêæ **Impact of Noise on Fauna (Animals, Birds, Insects):**

| Impact                   | Details                                                                 |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| üê¶ Birds                 | Altered nesting patterns, migration avoidance, reduced mating calls     |
| üêøÔ∏è Mammals              | Increased stress hormones, habitat displacement                         |
| üê∏ Amphibians & Insects  | Affected communication (like frogs and crickets), which depend on sound |
| üêï Pets/Domestic animals | Behavioral issues, anxiety, reduced productivity in farm animals        |

---

## üî¨ **Assessment of Noise Impact:**

### üîπ 1. **Baseline Noise Monitoring:**

Before a project starts, record current noise levels using **sound level meters**. This sets the reference level.

### üîπ 2. **Prediction Modeling:**

Use models like **FHWA Noise Model** or **ISO 9613** to **predict future noise levels** from project operations.

### üîπ 3. **Comparison with Standards:**

Compare predicted noise levels with **CPCB or WHO noise standards**:

* Residential zone: 55 dB (day) / 45 dB (night)
* Silent zone (near hospitals): 50 dB / 40 dB

### üîπ 4. **Impact Zone Mapping:**

Map areas where the noise exceeds safe levels using **GIS tools**.

---

## ‚úÖ **Mitigation Measures:**

| Method              | Description                                              |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| üå≥ Buffer Zones     | Planting trees and shrubs to absorb noise                |
| üß± Sound Barriers   | Concrete walls or noise shields along highways or sites  |
| üîá Silent Machinery | Use of low-noise construction equipment                  |
| üïê Time Regulations | Avoid construction at night when animals are more active |
| üö´ Restricted Zones | Limit access or operations near wildlife sanctuaries     |

---

## üìã **Example Case:**

In a **highway expansion project near a forest**:

* Noise levels were predicted to increase by 20 dB.
* Bird nesting areas within 200m of the road saw fewer nests and eggs.
* Mitigation included sound barriers and speed limits to reduce noise.

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è Conclusion:

The prediction and assessment of noise impacts on flora and fauna are **critical** in EIA. It ensures development happens **without harming biodiversity**. Using monitoring tools, predictive models, and implementing mitigation strategies helps achieve **ecological balance** during and after project execution.
