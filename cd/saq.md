# RPA Short Answer Questions - CO1

**1. What is Robotic Process Automation (RPA) and why is it needed?**
RPA is a technology that uses software robots to automate repetitive, rule-based business processes. It is needed to reduce manual effort, minimize human errors, increase operational efficiency, and free up employees for higher-value tasks.

**2. Define RPA and list its key characteristics.**
RPA is the use of software bots to mimic human actions and automate repetitive tasks. Key characteristics include: rule-based automation, non-invasive integration, scalability, and ability to work 24/7 without human intervention.

**3. How does RPA differ from traditional automation?**
RPA works at the user interface level without requiring code changes to existing systems, while traditional automation requires backend integration and coding. RPA is faster to deploy, non-invasive, and can work across multiple applications seamlessly.

**4. List and briefly explain any four benefits of RPA.**
(i) Cost Reduction - Reduces operational costs by automating manual tasks; (ii) Accuracy - Eliminates human errors; (iii) Productivity - Enables 24/7 operations; (iv) Scalability - Easy to scale up or down based on business needs.

**5. What are the different types of RPA bots?**
The main types are: (i) Attended bots - Work alongside humans and require human trigger; (ii) Unattended bots - Work independently without human intervention; (iii) Hybrid bots - Combine features of both attended and unattended bots.

# UiPath Basics Short Answer Questions - CO2

**1. List any four key features of UiPath.**
(i) Visual drag-and-drop interface; (ii) Recorder functionality for capturing user actions; (iii) Extensive activity library; (iv) Integration with multiple applications and technologies; (v) Orchestrator for centralized management.

**2. What are the panels available in UiPath Studio?**
UiPath Studio has: Activities Panel (contains all automation activities), Properties Panel (displays activity properties), Output Panel (shows execution messages), and Project Panel (displays project files and dependencies).

**3. What are arguments in UiPath? How are they different from variables?**
Arguments are used to pass data between workflows, while variables store data within a workflow. Arguments have directions (In, Out, In/Out) and enable data exchange between parent and child workflows, whereas variables have scope limited to their workflow.

**4. Explain any two data types used in UiPath.**
(i) String - Stores text data enclosed in quotes; (ii) Int32 - Stores integer values from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647; (iii) Boolean - Stores True or False values.

**5. What is the use of 'Assign' activity in UiPath?**
The Assign activity is used to assign values to variables. It takes two parameters: the variable name on the left side and the value/expression to be assigned on the right side, enabling data manipulation within workflows.

# Control Flow & Exception Handling Short Answer Questions - CO3

**1. What is exception handling in RPA?**
Exception handling is a mechanism to handle runtime errors and unexpected situations during bot execution. It helps maintain workflow stability by catching errors and executing alternative logic to prevent complete failure.

**2. What is the use of try-catch block in UiPath?**
The Try-Catch block captures exceptions that occur in the Try section and handles them in the Catch section. It prevents workflow termination by providing alternative error-handling logic and ensuring graceful error recovery.

**3. List various activities available for control flow in UiPath.**
Control flow activities include: If, Else If, Switch, While, Do While, For Each, Break, and Flow Decision. These activities help control the execution sequence and implement conditional logic in workflows.

**4. Write a short note on decision making using 'If' activity.**
The If activity evaluates a Boolean condition and executes different branches based on True or False results. It contains Then section (executed when condition is True) and Else section (executed when condition is False).

**5. How do you handle validation errors in UiPath?**
Validation errors can be handled using Try-Catch blocks to capture exceptions, using If conditions to validate data before processing, implementing Retry Scope for transient failures, and logging errors for analysis and debugging.

# UI Automation & Selectors Short Answer Questions - CO4

**1. What are selectors in UiPath?**
Selectors are XML strings that identify UI elements on screen for automation. They store attributes of UI elements like name, id, class, and enable UiPath to locate and interact with specific elements during execution.

**2. Differentiate between full and partial selectors.**
Full selectors contain complete information including top-level window details and work independently. Partial selectors rely on container activities for top-level window information and contain only element-specific attributes, making them more flexible.

**3. List screen scraping techniques used in UiPath.**
Screen scraping techniques include: Full Text method (fast, accurate with hidden text), Native method (works well with desktop apps), OCR (Optical Character Recognition for images), and Data Scraping (for structured data extraction from tables).

**4. What are recording types available in UiPath?**
Recording types include: Basic Recording (for single activities), Desktop Recording (for desktop applications), Web Recording (for browser automation), Image Recording (for virtual environments), and Citrix Recording (for virtual machines).

**5. Explain the role of anchor base in automation.**
Anchor Base uses a stable UI element (anchor) as reference point to locate another nearby element whose position may vary. It improves reliability by finding target elements relative to fixed anchors when selectors are unstable.

# Orchestrator Short Answer Questions - CO5

**1. What is UiPath Orchestrator?**
UiPath Orchestrator is a web-based centralized platform for managing, monitoring, and deploying RPA robots. It provides features like robot scheduling, queue management, asset storage, and logging for enterprise-level automation management.

**2. What is the role of queues in UiPath Orchestrator?**
Queues store transaction items that need to be processed by robots in a FIFO manner. They enable load distribution across multiple robots, provide transaction status tracking, and support exception handling for failed items.

**3. What is the use of assets in Orchestrator?**
Assets store shared variables and credentials (text, boolean, integer, credential types) centrally in Orchestrator. They enable secure storage of sensitive data, easy updates without modifying workflows, and shared access across multiple robots.

**4. Define scheduling in Orchestrator.**
Scheduling allows administrators to configure when and how often robots should execute specific processes. It enables time-based automation, recurring executions, and optimal resource utilization by running bots during off-peak hours.

**5. Mention any two key components of Orchestrator dashboard.**
(i) Jobs - Displays execution status of running and completed processes; (ii) Robots - Shows connected robot status and availability; (iii) Queues - Monitors transaction processing and pending items.
